# Stock Market Analysis with Machine Learning

![Stock Market](stock_market.jpg)

## Description

This project aims to provide a basic foundation for analyzing recent stock market data using Python. It demonstrates how to fetch and visualize recent stock data for a specified company using the Alpha Vantage API and Matplotlib. This is a starting point for anyone interested in exploring stock market data and potentially building machine learning models for stock price prediction.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Alpha Vantage API Key (Sign up at [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/farheenfathimaa/Stock-Market-Analysis-with-Machine-Learning
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd stock-market-analysis
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install alpha_vantage matplotlib
   ```

4. Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` in the code with your actual Alpha Vantage API key.

### Running the Code

Run the Python script to fetch and visualize recent stock data:

```bash
python stock_analysis.py
```

## Customize

- Change the `symbol` variable in the `stock_analysis.py` script to fetch data for a different stock or company.
- Modify the code to include machine learning models for stock price prediction.
